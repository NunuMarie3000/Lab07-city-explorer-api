# Lab07-city-explorer-api

**Author**: Storm O'Bryant
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

Problem domain: As an addition to Lab 06, which began creation of a city explorer application that allows the user to look up a city, location, destination, and view a map of that location, we know would like to implement server side that would allow the user to (in the future) be able to check the weather for their searched location. For now, we're using static placeholder data.

## Getting Started

To build this app on your own machine:

* create a server with Express(include all necessary files, including, but not limited to: placeholder weather data, gitignore/dotenv file, and a file that will hold all your server information)

* 

## Architecture

In this application, I will be using:

* dotenv
* express
* cors
